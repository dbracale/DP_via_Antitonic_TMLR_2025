This repository contains the code necessary to run the simulations included in Section 5 "Simulations" of our work "Dynamic Pricing in the Linear Valuation Model using Shape Constraints".

Section 5.1 "Simulation for theoretical validation". All the simulations are in the file Simulations_for_theory.py.

Section 5.2 "Comparison with Tullii et al. (2024)". The files vape_algorithm_adversarial.py and fan_algorithmic_adversarial.py, contain the code for the implementation of the VAPE algorithm in the case of the linear valuation and Fan et al. 2021 respectively, implemented by Tullii et al. (2024). The file antitonic_algorithm_adversarial.py contains the implementation of our algorithm 1. The complete run of the algorithm that resulted in Figure 3 in the paper can be obtained by running the file full_comparison.py.
